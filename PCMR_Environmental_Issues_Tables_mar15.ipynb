This is attributable to the longer time required for trees and shrubs to mature and produce seed as well as the rather limited dispersal capability of most tree species.

Backfilling was carried out closely behind the pipe lowering-in process.  Backfilling was undertaken using a tracked excavator during unfrozen and frozen soil conditions.    2.7 PRESSURE TESTING  Enbridge obtained all applicable hydrostatic testing permits/approvals and water withdrawal/discharge activities were conducted in accordance with provincial and federal approval conditions.   Hydrostatic test activities began on August 20, 2012 and were completed by December 5, 2012.  A total of four hydrostatic tests were completed from KP 0+000 to KP 62+550 which included three ‘short’ sections consisting of two HDD crossings  (the Alameda Reservoir East and West) and the kick-off section at the Bakken pump station, and the fourth test consisted of testing for the entire completed pipeline.  The hydrostatic testing was completed using water withdrawn from the Alameda Reservoir, Pipestone Creek, and multiple private water sources as required.  Hydrostatic testing of the kick-off section at the Bakken pump station used rented fluid containing methanol which was returned to the supplier after testing was complete.  2.8 CLEAN-UP AND RECLAMATION  Clean-up and reclamation operations began September 27, 2012 and were completed November 28, 2013 (no clean-up and reclamation activities occurred between December 2012 and April 2013).

As expected, there was a substantial change in the structure of the vegetation on the corridor following construction of the pipeline and restoration of the corridor.

This is attributable to the longer time required for trees and shrubs to mature and produce seed as well as the rather limited dispersal capability of most tree species.

      "Table 1 provides locations where mitigation (para-tilling) was conducted in 2012, along with 2013 and 2014 assessments and follow-up for the Alberta locations. Mechanical compaction relief was completed in Alberta after the 2012 crop year at all sites with a para-tiller implement, and in the majority of locations, dehydrated manure pellets were also injected into the subsoil. Additional para-tilling was conducted in 2014 within temporary workspace utilized as a soil borrow area. This area was monitored in 2015, and there were some minor crop productivity issues evident on a couple sites. The locations were monitored in 2016, with no issues noted, and there were no concerns raised by landowners.

Backfilling was carried out closely behind the pipe lowering-in process.  Backfilling was undertaken using a tracked excavator during unfrozen and frozen soil conditions.    2.7 PRESSURE TESTING  Enbridge obtained all applicable hydrostatic testing permits/approvals and water withdrawal/discharge activities were conducted in accordance with provincial and federal approval conditions.   Hydrostatic test activities began on August 20, 2012 and were completed by December 5, 2012.  A total of four hydrostatic tests were completed from KP 0+000 to KP 62+550 which included three ‘short’ sections consisting of two HDD crossings  (the Alameda Reservoir East and West) and the kick-off section at the Bakken pump station, and the fourth test consisted of testing for the entire completed pipeline.  The hydrostatic testing was completed using water withdrawn from the Alameda Reservoir, Pipestone Creek, and multiple private water sources as required.  Hydrostatic testing of the kick-off section at the Bakken pump station used rented fluid containing methanol which was returned to the supplier after testing was complete.  2.8 CLEAN-UP AND RECLAMATION  Clean-up and reclamation operations began September 27, 2012 and were completed November 28, 2013 (no clean-up and reclamation activities occurred between December 2012 and April 2013).  Clean-up and reclamation activities included subsoil decompaction, topsoil replacement, seeding, and removal of construction debris (survey stakes, dewatering bags, etc.).      is 1\n",
